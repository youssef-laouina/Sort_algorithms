# Python Sort Algorithms

Welcome to the Python Sort Algorithms repository!

## About This Repository

This repository contains various sorting algorithms implemented in Python. From classic algorithms like bubble sort and insertion sort to more advanced ones like merge sort and quick sort, we explore different techniques for efficiently sorting data.

## Implemented Algorithms

### Bubble Sort (bubble_sort.py)

Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.

### Insertion Sort (insertion_sort.py)

Insertion sort works by building a sorted list one element at a time. It takes each element from the input list and inserts it into its correct position in the sorted list.

### Linear Merge Sort (Iterative and Recursive Versions)

#### Iterative Linear Merge Sort (linear_merge_iterative.py)

Linear merge sort is a variation of merge sort that iteratively divides the input list into smaller sublists and merges them together in a sorted manner.

#### Recursive Linear Merge Sort (linear_merge_recursive.py)

Recursive linear merge sort follows the same principles as the iterative version but uses recursion to divide and conquer the input list.

### Merge Sort (Iterative and Recursive Versions)

#### Iterative Merge Sort (merge-sort-iterative.py)

Merge sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that recursively divides the input list into smaller sublists, sorts them, and then merges them back together.

#### Recursive Merge Sort (merge-sort-recursive.py)

Recursive merge sort is the recursive implementation of the merge sort algorithm, which efficiently sorts large datasets by recursively dividing them into smaller sublists.

### Quick Sort (quick_sort.py)

Quick sort is another efficient divide-and-conquer algorithm that sorts the input list by selecting a pivot element, partitioning the list around the pivot, and recursively sorting the sublists.

## How to Use

Each Python file contains the implementation of a specific sorting algorithm. You can run these scripts directly or integrate them into your projects as needed.

## Contributing

Contributions to this repository are welcome! Whether you have improvements to the existing algorithms or want to add new ones, feel free to submit pull requests.
